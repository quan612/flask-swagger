# flask-swagger

I used pipenv

* We can start by running:
```bash
  pipenv install
 ```

* May need to manually create a database

* Then changing MySql credentials in "config.py"

* Launching virtual env

```console
  pipenv shell
 ```
 
* Seed the data
```console
  python seed.py
 ```

* start the flask
```console
  python manage.py
 ```
 
 * The swagger is at 
 ```console
   http://localhost:5000/ui/
 ```
